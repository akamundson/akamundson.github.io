				<p>	I am a student at UW-Madison, and I love being basic. I work as a brewista at Starbucks, and lattes are life.  One of the best parts about my job is the ability to wear yoga pants all day. They are so comfortable and fashionable. Lululemon everything.  My favorite color is all of the colors of fall. Fall is honestly the BEST season. The air is so crisp, and I get to wear all of my designer boots. I am absolutely obsessed with my mid-height leather riding boots. They work so well with all of my outfits. However, the real gem of my closet has got to be my warm, furry, fuzzy UGG boots.  Nothing says fall like some UGGS. When I am wearing my boots, I have got to pair them with my long, black North face jacket. It is just the perfect length!! On those cold days, I love to cozy up with a cup of organic coca tea. Organic is the only way to go when it comes to consuming.  There are so many yucky pesticides that will most def ruin the radiant shine in my golden hair. I am also part-time vegan, full time ovo-lacto-pesco-vegetarian. I find that it is too restricting to be full time vegan, but I am also environmentally conscious and want to protect the little cute baby animals. I just couldnt give up non-fat yogurt or milk for my lattes, so that is why I am full time ovo-lacto-pesco-vegetarian. If you want to get to know me, you can just look up at my astrological sign. I am TOTES a Libra.  You will find that my strengths are my: grace, idealism, and my peaceful and diplomatic nature.  Some of my weaknesses are my superficial, indecisive, unreliable and vain tendencies. Overall, I just love to keep things in balance. Speaking of balance, I am so obsessed with hot yoga. I can honestly feel the toxins leave my body and feel the positive energy replacing it. My second favorite thing about yoga is the excuse to buy more yoga pants. When I am not at yoga, you will find me party planning!! I love to get the whole house looking great with cute little decorations and cute little snacks and drinks that I get off my Pinterest account.  Everyone says I am the best party planner. </p>
			<h2> The Notebook, Boys and Wine </h2>
				<p>   I also love to have wine at parties. Wine is the best drink. My favorite wine has got to be the driest, lighest, non-domestic white wine. I find that you can taste the American in domestic wine, and it does not taste good. Sweden or Germany is a much more refined taste when compared to America. When I drink wine, I always start to get loud. Then I am telling my best friend how much she means to me, how mean boys are, and how fat I feel. My friends always tell me I a beautiful, and that makes me feel better for a while until I start crying and go get gelato. Eating gelato and watching a romantic comedy is the best way to get over any disappointment of life. Lost my job. Rom com.  Forgot to upgrade my I phone. Rom com. Missed my hair appointment. Rom com. And it just keeps getting worse and worse. I am so grateful for Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. Their touching love story pulled apart by mental disorder and brought back together by the power of love will always bring me to an ugly cry at the end. All I really want is a love story like Noah and Allie. #relationshipgoals.  I also think that hashtags are the best invention ever. I mean, I get the importance of the wheel and fire and agriculture, but not being able to hashtag my new short haircut with #shorthairdontcare would be tragic. My insta is always blowing up. Really, I have to post my outfits for the day on instagram, otherwise my fans will be upset. They probably will not be able to move on with their day until they see my plum-olive combo.  I do not do it for myself; I do it for the people. And, the only time I ever post a picture in a bikini is when I am with my ladies on a dock and we are holding hands jumping into the water. Again, I do not do it for attention, its for the people. They need me; they want me. And yeah, sometimes I do stalk my Ex-Boyfriends on their accounts to see what they are up to and what trash they are dating now. I just hope that he realizes what he lost. I am such a wonderful person. Also, all of my friends said I was better than him, so the loss was obviously bigger for him. In fact, I do not even really care if he has a girlfriend or not. I mean, I am so happy to be single. My ladies are all I need. Now I do not have to stay home and have someone to talk to, or have someone to hug me after a hard day or. *not crying right now* Never mind, I am totally happy to be single. But there is this one really cute guy in my class who is for sure into me. That will have to wait. Ill just wear a really cute outfit to class and laugh at his jokes and flip my hair so he get the signal loud and clear that I am interested in him. I just know that since his birthday is in January, and he is a Capricorn, that we will be soul mates! With my balanced head and his down to earth attitude, we will be a more notable couple than Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. But I am really not thaaaaaat into him. I mean, not like I actually like him. He is just cute. Anyway, I really have to go shopping since I did not go last week. I will have to end it here. Thank you for loving me as much as I love me.     </p>
